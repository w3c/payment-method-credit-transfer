			<p>This section describes payment method specific data that is supplied as part of the <code>data</code>

				<p>The <dfn><code>PushSCTRequest</code></dfn> dictionary contains the request from the

				<p>The fields are based upon the Customer to Bank Credit Transfer Initiation (DS-01) specification from <a href="http://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/index.cfm/knowledge-bank/epc-documents/sepa-credit-transfer-rulebook-version-81/">SEPA Credit Transfer Rulebook Version 8.1</a></p>

				<div class="issue" title="Other references useful?">
				We have referenced the SEPA Rule Book, however we should define the ISO20022 mappings also to be more specific <a href="https://www.iso20022.org/documents/messages/pain/schemas/pain.001.001.07.zip">CustomerCreditTransferInitiationV07</a> (PAIN001.001.007)

					The above field is also required in the BasicCardRequest, does this need modelling in the a superclass or base api?

					<div class="issue" title="Failed payment edge cases?">
					The above field is required, but this can result in failed payments after 'Authorise' clicked. Should we have a better modelling (e.g. using subclasses) to allow for a more fine grained matching of apps to requests? Does the PMI specification need to support this?
