	<h2>CreditTransferRequest</h2>

	<div class="note">The current fields are drawn from the Customer to Bank Credit Transfer Initiation (DS-01) specification from <a href="http://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/index.cfm/knowledge-bank/epc-documents/sepa-credit-transfer-rulebook-version-81/">SEPA Credit Transfer Rulebook Version 8.1</a>. However the field names are amended in this specification to better align with W3C protocols. Mappings are provided in the field descriptions and are prefixed "AT-xx". Please note implementation restrictions (e.g., number of characters) in the SEPA Rulebook that are not indicated below. The Editors are also considering moving in the direction of terms used in the <a href="https://www.swift.com/standards/market-practice/common-global-implementation">Common Global Implementation (CGI)</a>.</div>

	<pre class="idl">
	  dictionary CreditTransferRequest {
	  sequence&lt;DOMString&gt; requiredResponseFields;
	  sequence&lt;DOMString&gt; supportedCountries;
	    
          required DOMString payeeIBAN;
	  DOMString payeeName;
	  required DOMString payeeBIC;
	  DOMString payeeIdentificationCode;

	  required DOMString payeePaymentIdentificationHumanReadable;
          DOMString payeePaymentIdentificationMachineReadable;

	  required DOMString purposeCode;
	  DOMString categoryPurposeCode;
	    
	  DOMString preferredProcessingDate;
	  DOMString notificationURL;
	  };
	</pre>

	<p>The <code>CreditTransferRequest</code> dictionary contains the following fields:</p>
	
	<dl>
	  <dt><dfn><code>requiredResponseFields</code></dfn></dt>
	  <dd>Contains the list of fields that the Payment App must attempt to return, if this requirements cannot be met, e.g., the payment instrument must fail as this is a push payment.
	  	  <div class="issue" title="Failed payment edge cases?">
	    The above field is required, but this can result in failed payments after 'Authorise' clicked. Should we have a better modelling (e.g. using subclasses) to allow for a more fine-grained matching of apps to requests? Does the PMI specification need to support this?
	  </div>
	  </dd>

	  <dt><dfn><code>supportedCountries</code><dfn></dt>
	  <dd>The supportedCountries field contains a sequence of [[!ISO3166-2]] identifiers of countries from which the merchant accepts credit transfers. This value is optional. If a value is not provided then the merchant accepts credit transfers from any country. 
	  </dd>

	  <dt><dfn><code>payeeIBAN</code></dfn></dt>
	  <dd>This field indicates the account number of the payee (the merchant) that will be used for the credit transfer. This will typically be an IBAN number, or a domestic account number for those countries that do not use IBAN.</dd>
	  <dd>AT-20: The IBAN of the account of the Beneficiary.</dd>

	  <dt><dfn><code>payeeBIC</code></dfn></dt>
	  <dd>The Bank code of the payee that should be used along the “payeeIBAN” in order to send the Credit Transfer.</dd>
	  <dd>AT-23: the BIC code of the beneficiary.</dd>
	  <dd>Note: Even if the BIC could be derived from the IBAN in most of SEPA country, it may be not the case in others, so this field is important. The merchant should know the BIC of his account.
This field could be also used with another format of “bank identification code” for countries not using BIC.</dd>

	  <dt><dfn><code>payeeName</code></dfn></dt>
	  <dd>The name of the payee known to the bank that holds the account describe by “payeeIBAN”.</dd>

      <h2>Appendix: Design Considerations</h2>
      <p>The following are design considerations for this specification.</p>
      <ul>
	<li>The specification should work for multiple credit transfer
	  systems. In the WPWG we identified systems such as ACH,
	  SEPA, BACS, and CHAPS, but that list is neither exhaustive
	  nor definitive.</li>
	<li>When faced with a design choice, prefer the option that
	  favors low-value payments over high-value payments.</li>
