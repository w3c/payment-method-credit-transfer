        This specification is a Payment Method specification for use with the
        PaymentRequest API [[PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]]. With it, merchants and payers
        can exchange information required for credit transfers across a variety
        of payment systems.

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification is a Payment Method Specification used by the
        PaymentRequest API [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] to support payment by credit
        transfer.

      <p>
        This specification relies on several other underlying specifications.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          Payment Request API
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The term <dfn>PaymentRequest constructor</dfn> is defined by the
          PaymentRequest API specification [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]].
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Payment Method Identifiers
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The term <dfn data-lt="payment method identifiers">payment method
          identifier</dfn> is defined by the Payment Method Identifier
          specification [[!METHODIDENTIFIERS]].
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Web IDL
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The IDL in this specification is defined by Web IDL [[!WEBIDL]].
        </dd>
        <dt>
          CLDR
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Country codes used in this specification are only used for filtering;
          country information is not part of the payment message. We thus align
          with the choice of Payment Request API, which is to use [[!CLDR]].

            <a href="https://www.bacs.co.uk/Pages/Home.aspx">BACS</a> Direct
            Credit Scheme, a non-realtime scheme for UK domestic payments.
            Payments typically take between 3 and 5 days to settle to the
            destination account and there is no notification, merchants must
            check their statements and manually reconcile using the 'reference'
            (<code>payeePaymentIdentificationHumanReadable</code>)

          <li>
            <a href="http://www.fasterpayments.org.uk/">Faster Payments (UK)
            Scheme</a>, which operates similar to BACS, but typically settling

            The CreditTransferResponse message means that a message has been
            submitted to the Payee's Bank, not that funds transfer has
            occurred. The merchant should wait for notification from its Bank
            that the payment has cleared.

        Owners of web sites SHOULD NOT store the payer's information except

      <p>
        The following are design considerations for this specification.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The specification should work for multiple credit transfer systems.
        In the WPWG we identified systems such as ACH, SEPA, BACS, and CHAPS,
        but that list is neither exhaustive nor definitive.
        </li>
        <li>When faced with a design choice, prefer the option that favors
        low-value payments over high-value payments.
        </li>
        <li>Payment apps are responsible for payer authentication. They may
        delgate this responsibility to issuing banks or third-party providers.
        </li>
      </ul>
