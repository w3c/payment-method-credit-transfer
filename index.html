        Introduction

      <p>
        This specification is a Payment Method Specification used by the
        PaymentRequest API [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] to support payment by credit
        transfer.

        This specification relies on several other underlying specifications.

        <dt>
          Payment Method Identifiers
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The term <dfn data-lt="payment method identifiers">payment method
          identifier</dfn> is defined by the Payment Method Identifier
          specification [[!METHODIDENTIFIERS]].
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Web IDL
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The IDL in this specification is defined by Web IDL [[!WEBIDL]].
        </dd>
        <dt>
          CLDR
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Country codes used in this specification are only used for filtering;
          country information is not part of the payment message. We thus align
          with the choice of Payment Request API, which is to use [[!CLDR]].

	<h3>Faster Payments UK and BACS</h3>

	<pre class="example" title="BACS and Faster Payments Example">
          
          const CreditTransferRequest = {
          supportedNetworks: ["BACS", "UKFasterPayments],

          payeeAccountNumber: "12345678", // Bob Ltd.'s 8 digit UK bank account number 
          payeeName: "Bob Ltd.", // Merchant name
          payeeBankCode: "12-34-56", // Bob Ltd.'s 6 digit sort code
          payeePaymentIdentificationHumanReadable: "Payment from Alice, account number 87654321", // whilst payment reference is optional for BACS scheme, this text is used for reconciliation so the merchant can check they have been paid
          payeePaymentIdentifierMachineReadable: "abcdefgh123456789" // unique transaction reference, not used by BACS scheme, but Payment App can use to dedeplicate
          }
         
	</pre>


	<p>This example refers to two credit transfer systems:</p>
	
	<ul>

	  <li><a href="https://www.bacs.co.uk/Pages/Home.aspx">BACS</a>
	      Direct Credit Scheme, a non-realtime scheme for UK
	      domestic payments. Payments typically take between 3 and
	      5 days to settle to the destination account and there is
	      no notification, merchants must check their statements
	      and manually reconcile using the 'reference'
	      (<code>payeePaymentIdentificationHumanReadable</code>)</li>

	  <li><a href="http://www.fasterpayments.org.uk/">Faster
	      Payments (UK) Scheme</a>, which operates similar to
	      BACS, but typically settling in a few hours.</li>

            A unique identifier for a given payer each Credit Transfer
            Transaction presented to the payer Bank. This number will be
            transmitted in the entire process of the handling of the credit
            transfer transactions from acceptance until the finality of the
            transaction. It must be returned in any exception handling
            process-step by any party involved. The payer cannot request for
            any other referencing information to be returned to him, in order
            to identify a credit transfer. The payer must define the internal
            structure of this reference; it can only be expected to be
            meaningful to the payer.

      <p>
        The following are design considerations for this specification.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The specification should work for multiple credit transfer systems.
        In the WPWG we identified systems such as ACH, SEPA, BACS, and CHAPS,
        but that list is neither exhaustive nor definitive.
        </li>
        <li>When faced with a design choice, prefer the option that favors
        low-value payments over high-value payments.
        </li>
        <li>Payment apps are responsible for payer authentication. They may
        delgate this responsibility to issuing banks or third-party providers.
