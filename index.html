      </h2>
      <p>
        The following are design considerations for this specification.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The specification should work for multiple credit transfer systems.
        In the WPWG we identified systems such as ACH, SEPA, BACS, and CHAPS,
        but that list is neither exhaustive nor definitive.
        </li>
        <li>When faced with a design choice, prefer the option that favors
        low-value payments over high-value payments.
        </li>
        <li>Payment apps are responsible for payer authentication. They may
        delgate this responsibility to issuing banks or third-party providers.
